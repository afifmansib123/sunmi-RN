### Lesson 5 - Constants and Types ###

it is always a good idea to keep constants like spacing , colors and 
other constants standard in one file. 
For Types as well we will keep all types in a file that keeps track of everything. 

check files :

--- src/constants/theme.ts ---
--- src/types/index.ts ---
